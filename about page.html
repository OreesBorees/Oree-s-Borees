				Writing without giving a reason is one of the hurdles I am conquering in my life. Until I have climbed that mountain, I will provide a bit of insight into why I created this website and what I hope to get out of it.
			<br>
			<br>
				This blog is meant to serve as a way of refocusing the locus of control I have in the creative and intellectual parts of my life. This world is crazy. It’s got things going on all the time and it can be hard to find our place in it. Things are constantly racing through our heads as priorities shift and new matters take mental energy. It is important to get these thoughts and frustrations out and on paper to keep our sanity—hence why this blog is being made. Not everyone wants to talk about these things all the time, I know I don't, but when there’s an itch, you gotta scratch it and there isn’t always someone available. If shouting into a void on the Internet satisfies that itch, then scratch it.

				This is a research-focused and conversation-forward blog. The monologues that are being pushed forth come from one background in the sea of perspective. At the end of the day, I am merely an [intentional] aesthetician. Disagreement and discussion are always welcome, but fallacies of any sort and bad faith arguments will not be entertained. I am open to having my perspective challenged and you should too.
			<br>
			<br>
				There are three goals behind the production of this blog:

			<li>Articulating my thoughts to further invigorate my making practice (this one gets complicated)</li>

				I don’t speak for the world; I speak from a voice that has familiarity with a few of the many social functions in the United States. As a result, that’ll be the context I speak in unless noted otherwise.
			<br>
			<br>
				“white” (regarding generally to the people and its essence) will always be lowercase. This will be the norm and exceptions will be noted.
			<br>
			<br>
				The capitalization of the letter “b” within “black” specifically (regarding generally to the people and its essence) will vary depending upon the level of consciousness and self-liberation I am referring to. Just because one may be black doesn’t necessarily mean that they think Black.
			<br>
			<br>
				No material is too invaluable to serve as insight [shoutout to all the high school teachers saying not to use Wikipedia]. Throughout my entries, I will cite my sources and provide links to my references. I am not fully familiar with any research citation styles and don’t know how much I want to legitimize it in this blog, but I think its employment would be useful for those who want to learn more.
