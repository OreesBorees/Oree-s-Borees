				<u>comment:</u> i was expecting this to be done at 12:03, but this simple upload has turned into a task; which either means i'm confused and/or the code's fucked. it's like 8 lines of text. why?... I also started this sober at work and now corrected it while high, not at work. a rare achievement.

				<u>comment:</u> i was thinking and decided i won't correct any syntax irks. i suppose its adjusting a mental breath which is a form of altering how the material is read, so if i don't catch it then that's how it's supposed to be read. i will still correct any typos i come across.
				<hr class="rule-d">
				<li><u>28.08.25 10:08 EST:</u> Typo/syntax correction on home, update, <i>A Visitaiton of Spirits</i> and <i>Women as Lovers</i> commentary pages. Fixed broken <i>A Talk About the Room</i> link. Changed commentary entry dates to dd,mm,yy for consistecy. Add "⫘⫘" to commentary, prose and essay pages.

  				<u>comment:</u> i thought it'd be fun to have transperancy for when i update the website. maybe some regularity can be tracked or just see how perspective ages. general updates will mainly consist of writing uploads and syntax/grammatical fixes. when i upload things like writing it's done. no "i go back and read 5 months later and feel different so i edit it" type things. iiwii. i don't remember older update dates, so this is the first. older ones can be seen in the <a class="font-mono" href="https://github.com/OreesBorees/Oree-s-Borees.git" target="_blank">github repository</a> for the site. nothing crazy. </li>
