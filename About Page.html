<br>
<br>
		Writing without giving a reason is one of the hurdles I am conquering in my life. Until I have climbed that mountain, I will provide a bit of insight into why I created this website and what I hope to get out of it. 
<br>
<br>
		This blog is meant to serve as a way of refocusing the locus of control I have in the creative and intellectual parts of my life. This world is crazy. It’s got things going on all the time, and it can be difficult to find our place in it. Things are constantly racing through our heads as priorities shift and new matters take mental energy. It is important to get these thoughts and frustrations out and on paper to keep our sanity—hence the intention behind this blog. Not everyone wants to talk about these things all the time; I know I don't, but when there’s an itch, you have to scratch it, and there isn’t always someone available. If shouting into a void on the Internet satisfies that itch, then scratch it.
<br>
<br>
		This is a research-focused and conversation-forward blog. The monologues I am presenting come from one background in the sea of perspective. Disagreement and discussion are always welcome, but there will be no entertaining of fallacies and poor faith arguments. I am open to having my perspective challenged, and you should too. At the end of the day, I am merely an [intentional] aesthetician. 
<br>
<br>
		There are three goals behind the production of this blog 
<br>
<br>
		✦ Exercise HTML/CSS coding and website building.
<br>
<br>
		✦ Practice researching, annotating, comprehending, and constructing intellectual conversations and arguments.
<br>
<br>
		✦ Challenge my thoughts to further invigorate my design practice (this one gets complicated).

		<p style="margin-left: 300px; margin-right: 300px; font-size: 15px; font-family: courier new;"> Topics regarding gender, race, sexuality, history, femininity, culture, etymology, design, architecture, media, algorithms, and digital hardware/software will be the bread and butter of this blog.

		I don’t speak for the world; I speak from a voice that has familiarity with a few of the many social functions in the United States. As a result, this will be the context that I speak in unless noted otherwise.. 
<br>
<br>
		“white” (regarding generally to the people and culture within the US) will always be lowercase. This will be the norm, and I will note exceptions.
<br>
<br>
		The capitalization of the letter “b” within “black” specifically (regarding generally to the people and culture within the US) will vary depending upon the level of consciousness and self-liberation I am referring to. Just because one may be black doesn’t necessarily mean that they think Black.
<br>
<br>
		No material is too invaluable to serve as insight [shoutout to all the high school teachers saying not to use Wikipedia]. Throughout my entries, I will cite my sources and provide links to my references. I am not fully familiar with any research citation styles and don’t know how much I want to legitimize it in this blog; however, I think the employment of links would be useful for those who want to learn more. 
<br>
<br>
		Objective abstraction is the intellectual white man’s game [shoutout <a href="https://observer.com/2021/03/hannah-baer-malefragility-trans-girl-suicide-museum-book-interview/" target="_blank"> Hannah Baer</a>]. I am neither white nor man (but ¼ intellectual) and will, therefore, be emotive in my abstraction. An objective certainty does not invalidate an emotive certainty. </p>
